            <h2>Thicker than Blood</h2><br><br>
            <p style="font-size: 20px;"> 
                You occupy the head of the table<br>
                a throne by your own right<br>
                Decreeing hate like it was absolute<br>
                Ratified by the passive nodding heads<br>
                But I refuse to acquiesce<br>
                to be a budding bigot even as a pretense<br>
                Now you must defend your ruse<br>
                stand your ground amidst flatterers and fools<br>
                and twist my mutinous silence along its spine<br>
                You brandish an unassailable vocabulary<br>
                and media truths<br>
                My rebuke is one that betrays ridicule<br>
                Sensing the derision, you take no chance<br>
                And lob me the priceless adage<br>
                ‘Once you are older, you will see<br>
                 The ways of life are not all as they seem’<br>
                Maybe it is true<br>
                Over the years, we barter with <br>
                Rationale and humanity<br>
                But must we so vehemently argue<br>
                The results of a trade which<br>
                for you, went so terribly?<br>
                You lament my stubborn defiance<br>
                and blame the ‘blasphemy’ on the streets<br>
                For all your love of the sacrosanct past<br>
                you deride its dwindling legacy<br>
                None of my words seem to reach you<br>
                Perhaps if they were in a text forward instead<br>
                I could convince your pragmatic self<br>
                Your axiomatic loyalty is for a republic<br>
                But not for its people <br>
                Not for its ideals<br>
                Only for its end<br>
                Tonight, I resign to defeat <br>
                yet I know<br>
                history will be kinder to me<br>
                than to just another proprietor of hate<br>
                <br><br><br>
